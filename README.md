# 🍪 Recipe Page (Learning Project)

This is a **work-in-progress learning project** where I’m experimenting with building a recipe page using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
I switched from using TheMealDB API to a **dummy JSON source** so I can focus more on the layout, styling, and experimenting with UI ideas without worrying about data fetching issues.
